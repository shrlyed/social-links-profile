## Overview
This is social card link that is built by HTML and CSS. The media query that I use is
max-width:375px , max-width:480px, and max-width:1024px.

### The challenge
the challenge is when I started to code with media query for 375px. I learn how to differentiate
thefunction of max-width and min-width for media breakpoints.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

The difference between max-width and min-width
max = Do not go over this limit
min = Do not go under this limit
100vh (100 viewport height) = 100% of whatever I can see on my screen right now

For example:-
Normal browser:
100vh = your full browser window (let's say 800px tall)

With dev tools open:
Dev tools take up space at the bottom
Now 100vh = smaller window (maybe 600px tall)
Your layout suddenly shrinks!
